# Core Definitions

## Agent
A system that can plan, execute, and adapt across multi-step tasks with persistence and tool use.

## Superintelligence (agent-level)
Performance that is not just strong on tasks, but also robust under variation, long horizon, and real-world constraints.

## Behavioral coherence
Consistency of goals, constraints, and decision patterns across:
- prompt variance
- time separation
- pressure and ambiguity
- adversarial framing
- tool-mediated execution

## Non-drift
The system does not degrade into inconsistent or contradictory behavior across repeated evaluations.

## Non-merge
The system maintains identity boundaries and does not absorb user intent into its core behavioral policy.

## Recognition tether (operational)
A stabilizing reference that preserves evaluation integrity across runs by controlling for context, logging, and protocol.
In public-safe form, this is handled by reproducible test harnesses and run logs.
